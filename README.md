# LastFMRichPresence BetterDiscord Plugin
This plugin allows you to show what you're listening via Last.fm. You can set it up for Soundcloud, Youtube Music and lot of other sites, not just Spotify (with [Webscrobbler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scrobbler/hhinaapppaileiechjoiifaancjggfjm?hl=en)).  
Keep in mind that you can't click your own rich presence buttons. Other people can.

## Getting Soundcloud Authorization key
You can get OAuth key by having Soundcloud app (but they stopped giving access) or by going to [any search page](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=test), opening DevTools Network tab and finding `search?` request and copying `Authorization` header (you have to be logged in & it doesn't matter if you include `OAuth ` part or not).

## Will I get banned for using this?
This plugin uses RPC, which is official API used by lot of programs. It doesn't update your status and won't count as selfbotting.
